  This is part of the narrative,
  even if I have the # symbol, it is still the narrative- not a comment

  Background: this is multi-line description
    do you like it?

    Given cheese is good

  @bar
  Scenario Outline: this is a test
    this the second line of the description

    Given I have a <var1> and some "string"
    And the following table and some 'string'
      | header 1 | header 2   |
      | cell 1-1 | cell 1-2   |
      | cell 2-1 | "cell 2-2" |
    When I do <var2>
    And here is a string with single and double quotes- "i'll be back"
    And here is a string with the opposite 'the quote is "Foo"'
    And what about a var in a quote like so: "<var2>"
    And what about a multiline string with a var in it like so:
      """
      Hello!
      I am a multiple line string, often called a pystring.
      I can have regular "double quotes" without a problem...
      I can also sub in vars as well like: <var1> and <var2>
      """
    Then I should see something...
    But not something else...

    Examples: 
      | var1 | var2 |
      | foo  | bar  |
      # since 0.7 this is still allowed
      | dog  | food |

    @new_tag
    Scenarios: some other examples with a description
    and guess what?!? I can have multilines as well! # look at me, I'm a comment (not supported by cucumber)
    Who would have thunk?

      | var1 | var2 |
      | foo  | bar  |
      | dog  | food |

  @some_tag @another_tag
  Scenario: more examples
    will follow after this multi-line description

    Given some context # this is an inline comment (no longer supported by cucumber)
